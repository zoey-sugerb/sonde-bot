# Radiosonde Notifier Bot
This project is designed to function as a discord and email bot to notify users of radiosonde landings near their location. It uses the Sondehub API and CUSF predictor in order to track sondes and predict landing locations, and ArcGIS and OSRM in order to calculate distances and routing times.
